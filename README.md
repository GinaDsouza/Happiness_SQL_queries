# Happiness_SQL_queries
The aim of this project is to compare happiness factors of India with other countries in order to understand what India is doing right and where it can improve.
The data set is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness
NOTE: the data is outdated and there are newer datasets. I have ignored those datasets as I am using this project to practice and apply my data skills.
There are 3 main query files. I use the dataset I obtained after appending the 2015-2019 datasets. I initially thought merging the data would be the right way to go but while trying to make data vizualisations in tableau, it was not easy. Hence I decided to appended the data instead so that the final dataset was in a useful form.
